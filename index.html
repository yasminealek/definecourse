      1. The Colosseum
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Colosseum's construction was started by emperor Vespasian of the
      Flavian dynasty in 72 AD and was finished by his son Titus in 80 AD. The
      elliptical amphitheater could hold up to 50,000 people who turned out to
      watch gladiators do battle, people be publicly executed and enjoy other
      forms of entertainment. This stone and concrete structure, built in the
      first century, was the largest amphitheater in the Roman Empire. It is
      considered one of the Romans’ greatest architectural and engineering
      feats.

        2. Pantheon
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p2>
      The Pantheon was built in 126 AD as a temple for all the Roman gods. The
      temple has served as a Roman Catholic Church since the 7th century. Eight
      graceful granite Corinthian columns extend across the front of this
      circular building, with lesser columns in back. Though it is 2,000 years
      old, the Pantheon’s famous dome remains the world’s largest unreinforced
      concrete dome. It is believed Marcus Agrippa built the Pantheon to be his
      private temple. The current building was reconstructed by Emperor Hadrian
      in the second century.

    <p3>
      The Vatican Museums began in the 16th century with a collection of
      sculptures by Pope Julius II. Today, they encompass several museums inside
      the Vatican City and include some of the world’s most important relics.
      Attractions of the museums include the spiral staircase, the Raphael Rooms
      and the exquisitely decorated Sistine Chapel. Michelangelo painted the
      chapel ceiling between 1508 and 1512. Today the ceiling, and especially
      The Last Judgment, are widely believed to be Michelangelo’s crowning
      achievements in painting. To keep the massive crowds under control, the
      museums have 4 itineraries that range from one and a half hours to more
      than 5 hours. All itineraries end in the Sistine Chapel.

      <h2>4. Trevi Fountain</h2>
    </div>
    <p4>
      Completed in 1762 to a design by Nicola Salvi, this world famous Baroque
      fountain features a mythological sculptural composition of Neptune, god of
      the sea, flanked by two Tritons. The location of the Trevi fountain marks
      the terminus of the ancient Aqua Virgo aqueduct and is so named on account
      of its position at the junction of three roads (tre vie). The fountain was
      the setting for an iconic scene in Fellini’s film Dolce Vita starring
      Anita Ekberg and Marcello Mastroianni. Since than, it has become one of
      the most popular tourist attractions in Rome. The legend says that one who
      throws a coin in the fountain shall one day return to Rome.

      Located in the small valley between the Palatine and Capitoline Hills, The
      Roman Forum (or Forum Romanum in Latin) was for centuries the teeming
      heart of ancient Rome: the site of triumphal processions and elections,
      venue for public speeches, and nucleus of commercial affairs. The Forum
      today is a sprawling ruin of architectural fragments and includes the
      Arches of Septimius Severus and Titus, the Temple of Antoninus Pius and
      Faustina and the Temple of Saturn.

      One of the most famous of Rome’s many squares, Piazza Navona was
      established towards the end of the 15th century, and preserves the shape
      of the Stadium of Domitian that once stood here. Built by Emperor Domitian
      in 86 AD, the stadium, which had a larger arena than the Colosseum was
      mainly used for festivals and sporting events. The buildings surrounding
      the square stand where the spectators once sat. Today, the square features
      no less than three magnificent fountains and is an immensely popular place
      to sip a cappuccino, shop, and watch street performers.
