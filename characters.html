            Jake Peralta

          <p class="characterinfo">
            Peralta is a cop that has never had to work that hard or follow the
            rules too closely. Perhaps because he has the best arrest record
            among his colleagues, he's been enabled - if not indulged -
            throughout his entire career. That is, until the precinct gets a new
            commanding officer, Captain Raymond Holt, who reminds this hotshot
            cop to respect the badge

            Rosa Diaz
          </h3>
          <p class="characterinfo">
            Detective Rosalita "Rosa" Diaz is a main character of the show. She
            is considered "the tough guy" and the "badass" in the Precinct. Rosa
            is scary, smart, secretive, and difficult to read. Most of the
            members of the precinct are frightened and a little disturbed by
            her. Rosa takes pride in the fact that no one knows much about her.
            Jake only knows three facts about her, one of which is that she
            won't let people crash at her place, despite the fact that Rosa
            refers to him as her "closest friend"

            Captain Raymond Holt
          </h3>
          <p class="characterinfo">
            Captain Raymond Jacob "Ray" Holt is one of the main characters of
            the show. He is the current Captain of the 99th Precinct and was
            formerly a uniformed officer. Outwardly he is strict, hardworking,
            stoic, staunchly professional, and a stickler for the rules.
            Inwardly, he is a warm, empathetic, devoted, and kind-hearted man
            who cares deeply about the officers and employees under his command
            and frequently participates in office antics, competitions, and
            pranks. Though he is often lampooned by his colleagues for his lack
            of displaying emotion or facial expressions, he is held in the
            highest regard by them and has developed close relationships with
            most of them.
